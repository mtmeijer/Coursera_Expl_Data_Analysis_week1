# Coursera Exploratory Data Analysis week1
Course projet from week 1 of the Exploratory Data Analysis course offered on Coursera
Assignment performed by M.T. Meijer


This repository contains 8 files, corresponding to the Course Project week 1 from the Exploratory Data Analysis course offered by John Hopkins University through Coursera.
These files are:

* Plot1.R
* Plot2.R
* Plot3.R
* Plot4.R
* Plot1.PNG
* Plot2.PNG
* Plot3.PNG
* Plot4.PNG

Each R file contains code to create the corresponding plot from the dataset "Electric power consumption". A link to the download as well as a brief description of the data and the full description of this assignment can be found through the ExData_Plotting1 forked from RDPeng to this github account.

For those who wish to use this code to replicate all 4 plots: the "get data" portions of Plot2.R, Plot3.R and Plot4.R are identical, and fully contain the "get data" portion of Plot1.R. Hence, by running the "get data" portion of one of these files, all plots can subsequently be created without the need to re-run this most heavy part of code.

Unfortunately, I did not manage to load only the desired rows of data in an efficient manner, so I decided to load the whole thing (which takes some time) and to extract the data from the desired dates afterwards. I am quite new to R, so any tips on how to make the code more efficient will be appreciated

Enjoy reviewing my take on this assignment, and I am looking forward to your feedback :)
